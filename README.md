### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Suyog Wani, 
Iâ€™m a passionate web developer with expertise in Python/Django. With a strong background in software security, I bring a unique perspective to building robust and secure web applications.
Iâ€™m looking for web developer role preferably on backend technologies.

ðŸ’» My tech stack: Python/Django, ReactJS, AWS, Terraform, EmberJS

ðŸ”’ As a member of a software security team, I have hands-on experience in identifying vulnerabilities, implementing security measures, and ensuring compliance with industry standards.

ðŸš€ I'm a firm believer in DevSecOps methodologies and have worked extensively with technologies like AWS Lambda and Terraform to streamline deployment processes and automate security practices.

ðŸŒ± Currently exploring new ways to enhance user experiences through intuitive and responsive interfaces, while keeping security at the forefront.
